# hashtag_recommender

This is an exploratory analysis of twitter hashtags with the aim to determine which hashtags contribute more strongly to a tweet's visibility, as measured by retweets and favorites. The goal is to be able to recommend hashtags, given a user's suggested tags, that are similar in content but more likely to yield views. 

The preliminary analysis is based on the dataset obtained at the following link: http://followthehashtag.com/datasets/free-twitter-dataset-usa-200000-free-usa-tweets/ 
This dataset contains 200,000 US tweets from April 2016, without re-tweets.
